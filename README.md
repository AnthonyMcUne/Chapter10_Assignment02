#HI! This is my Rock, Paper, Scissors Game! 
#This was built using only the tools available from the Python Turtle Graphics Module.
#To install and run the application, make sure that Python is up-to-date on your computer and download the application, opening it in your preferred IDE. (Visual Studio Code is free and available on the Microsoft Store!) 
#After downloading all the necessary files, simply run main.py and play the game! (Click on the image you choose (i.e. rock, paper, or scissor) to play!)
